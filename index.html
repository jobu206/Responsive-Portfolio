            <p>Thanks for checking out my bio page. This is a place where I hope to continue to refine and show my budding skills in Web Development. Over the past few years, I've been fortunate enough to work with some very brilliant people who have inspired me to pursue my passion of Web Development. My journey took me from working in the Mortgage Industry to working as a Contractor at MS to now being a Technical PM for a Consulting Agency. My hope is that through the skills I learn in this Bootcamp, I will find not only a job but a career.</p>
            
            <p>I have several passions that keep me busy outside of work and school. First and foremost, I have 2 young daughters who mean the world to me. We are a loving family filled with lots of laughter. I'm a lifelong Baseball fan. Ever since I was a little kid growing up in the Bay Area, I loved Baseball. There's nothing better than going to a Baseball Game in Summer. Now that I'm grown and have a family, I get to share that passion with my girls who love going to Baseball Games.</p>

            <p>I'm also an avid College Basketball Fan. Where are my Tar Heels at??!! One year for an early Birthday present, my wife bought us two tickets to NC to go watch the Tar Heels play. Sadly I wasn't able to see them beat Duke but we got a win nonetheless! In addition to the Tar Heels, I also enjoy watching the Huskies play Basketball. Each Summer, my Brother and I take time during the week to go watch the local HS Kids and incoming Freshment play Summer League Ball. You really get to see some great Basketball!!</p>
